How common are UFO sightings?  Where do they occur?  What do they look like?  For this challenge, we are able to search a data set of UFO sightings to help us answer these burning questions.  There are two levels to granularity.
* Level 1: Search by date only
* Level 2: Search by date, city, state, country, and/or shape of encounter

The results of these searches are returned via the filter function in javascript and the d3 library.

**Please note that if any of the search criteria is not met, then the all of the date in the repository is returned.
