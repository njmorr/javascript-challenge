How common are UFO sightings, and where do they occur?  For this challenge, we are able to search a repository of UFO sighting data.  There are two levels to granularity.
* Level 1: Search by date only
* Level 2: Search by date, city, state, country, and/or shape of encounter

**Please note that if any of the search criteria is no met, then the all the date in the repository is returned.
